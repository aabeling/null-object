Implementation of the null object design pattern in java.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern for an explanation of the pattern.

The idea for the implementation is taken from EasyMock.
Null safe objects can be created using static methods of the
NullSafe class.

This class uses the cglib to create a proxy.

Please see the NullSafeTest to get an idea how it is used.
